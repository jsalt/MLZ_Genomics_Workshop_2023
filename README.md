# MLZ Genomics Workshop 2023

This repository will hold code and general information for how to analyze UCE data using Oxy's high-performance computing cluster Bletchley.

## To-do *before* our first meeting

Follow the instructions for [Day 0](https://github.com/jsalt/MLZ_UCE_workshop_2023/blob/main/Day_0_MLZ_UCE_workshop.md). This will walk you through four steps:
1. Accessing Bletchley, the Oxy cluster
2. Installing Miniconda on Bletchley
3. Installing Phyluce on Bletchley
4. Installing the text editor Atom on your own computer

It is also a good idea to read through the [Bletchley Users Guide](https://github.com/justinnhli/bletchley-docs/blob/main/users.md) because we want to be considerate users of this shared resource!
